      Matcha Master is a Java-based desktop application designed to make exploring and organizing matcha 
      recipes both simple and visually engaging. Developed using Java Swing and a custom color palette of
      Matcha Green (#84BA61), Rose Pink (#DD8D8D), and White (#FFFFFF), the app offers an intuitive user interface
      that enhances the overall experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
          The design includes a welcoming splash screen animation followed
          by a clean, card-based navigation system for browsing Hot, Cold, and All recipe categories. 
          Each recipe page features a split layout for ingredients and steps, with interactive options 
          to favourite, take notes, and share. The Favourites page allows users to revisit their saved 
          recipes easily. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        This project demonstrates thoughtful integration of UI design principles, 
          structured Java programming, and user-centered thinking, reflecting a balance between 
          functionality and aesthetic simplicity.

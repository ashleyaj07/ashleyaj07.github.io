      <h2>UX Case Study</h2>
      <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Matcha Master</p>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Java Swing Desktop Recipe App</p>
      <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> BlueJ, ChatGPT, Notion</p>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Matcha Master is a recipe app designed exclusively for matcha lovers to explore, save,
        and organize different matcha recipes. The main goal was to build an engaging and
        accessible application with clear branding and a focus on minimalism.
      </p>

      <h3>User Research and Discovery</h3>
      <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
      <p><strong>Tasty</strong> – Pros: beginner-friendly, engaging video content, and community features.
        Cons: cluttered interface with ads, limited text-based browsing, and few search filters.</p>
      <p><strong>AllRecipes</strong> – Pros: strong database, user ratings, and reviews.
        Cons: overwhelming layout, poor branding, and ad-heavy design.</p>

      <h4>User Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        I interviewed two college students who are daily matcha drinkers. They were excited
        about an app dedicated to matcha recipes, especially one that saves them time and
        money compared to buying drinks from stores. Both emphasized the need for
        organized navigation, the ability to save and take notes, and minimal clutter.
      </p>

      <h4>Survey Insights</h4>
      <p>
        Most participants preferred minimal interfaces without ads, organized categories
        instead of long scrolling feeds, and an easy save option for recipes. Notes and sharing
        features were highly valued. While visuals were appreciated, users still preferred
        text and photo-based instructions for quick reference while cooking.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Users struggle to find a clean, organized matcha recipe app that allows them to
        save, categorize, and customize their experience. <strong>Matcha Master</strong> addresses
        this by focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and strong visual design.
      </p>

      <h3>Ideation and Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        I began with sketches and brainstorming sessions to map out potential layouts.
        I created user flows, personas, and wireframes before moving to high-fidelity
        prototypes. The final UI incorporated a grid-based recipe menu and clear
        navigation icons inspired by desktop software aesthetics.
      </p>

      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tested with two college students who are tea enthusiasts.</li>
        <li>Feedback included requests for icons and a split layout separating ingredients
          from steps.</li>
        <li>Final outcome: integrated icons and a split-view layout for improved readability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Matcha Master offers a minimal, organized, and engaging experience tailored for
        students and young professionals who enjoy matcha and home brewing. The app
        combines design clarity with personalization features such as favorites and notes.
      </p>

      <h3>UI Decisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Grid-based layout for clarity and easy navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Pixel Game Regular, Karmatic Arcade for a fun,
          game-like aesthetic.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> Matcha Green (#84BA61), Rose Pink (#DD8D8D), and White (#FFFFFF).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="case-image">
        <img src="assets/mm_color.png" alt="Matcha Master Colors">
        <p class="caption">Matcha Master – color scheme</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> High-contrast text and descriptive icons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This project taught me the importance of prioritization, documentation, and
        designing for accessibility. I learned to combine design clarity with functionality
        and focus on how small interface details can enhance user experience.
